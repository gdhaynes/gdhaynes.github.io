              <h1 class="mb-5">How to replace an HVAC air filter</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">Y</span>ears ago I got an offer for a job as an environmental geologist in
                Southeast Michigan, I was very excited for my first career
                level job and a chance to move away from home. I found an affordable apartment close to the office and
                in a historic neighborhood. Needless to say I was very excited
                and moved in in the spring. The spring turned to summer, then to fall and as the temps fell outside they
                also fell inside my apartment, I thought it was just because
                the apartment was in an old house and certainly it lacked insulation. Then as winter settled in my
                apartment would never get warmer that 55 degrees fahrenheit even though
                the thermostat was set to 70. I decided to investigate and in the basement I found a modern forced air
                furnace, a clogged filter, and old unsealed ductwork. That day I went to the local home improvement
                store, bought a new filter, and a roll of duct tape and got to work. After changing the furnace
                filter and sealing all the duct work I returned to my apartment and to
                my pleasant surprise it was a nice comfortable, almost too warm 72. Regularly replacing your HVAC filter
                is
                an easy task that saves on energy bills, and improves indoor air quality.</p>

              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/hvac filter new and old.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption>New filter (left) and a very old filter (right). Regularly changing your filter helps
                  improve indoor air quality and can help you
                  save on your energy bills.
                </figcaption>

              <h4>Do you have an HVAC air filter and why change them?</h4>
              <p>HVAC filters are air filters that are placed before the furnace or air handler on a ducted forced air
                HVAC system.
                they are there to filter the air before it runs through the HVAC equipment. This serves two purposes,
                first it keeps dust from building up
                on the surfaces of the HVAC system that either heat or cool the air, this keeps the system running
                efficiently. Second is that it helps
                maintain indoor air quality by filtering dust and other particulates. As filters age the filter pores
                fill with contaminants and air flow through
                the filter decreases increasing the
                energy needed to keep pulling air through the system. In addition they become less efficient at removing
                indoor air contaminants. Fortunately
                replacing these filters is a simple and inexpensive task.
              </p>
              <h4>How do I know how what filter I need?</h4>
              <p>If this is your first time replacing your filter(s) you will fist need to locate them in order to
                get a count of the filters needed and
                to get the size(s). They are often located on your furnace
                or air handler. These are large boxy looking pieces of equipment with large ducts going into and out
                of them. They are usually
                located in mechanical spaces such as a closet, basement, crawlspace, or attic. Filters may also be
                located behind one or more large centralized return air grates common in small homes or apartments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have determined the filter location(s) now you need to determine the size(s), if you have the
                manual(s)
                refer to those for the filter size. Otherwise the old filter is usually the same size as the one you
                will need.
                Before removing the old filer be sure to turn the HVAC system off, most furnaces and air handlers will
                have a switch
                on the side to turn off the unit, otherwise it can be done at the breaker box. Once the system has been
                turned off remove any filter
                covers and remove the old filter, its size should be printed on the side. Sometimes filter(s) of an
                incorrect size will be used
                if an old filter is too big or too small you will need to measure the filter slot to get the correct
                size.
              <p>Once you have determined the filter quantity and size(s),
                its time to purchase a new air filter, these can be bought at most
                home improvement stores. When purchasing a new filter you will see a host of numbers indicating what a
                filter will filter out.
                These are called MERV or Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value, the higher the number the finer the
                particulates it will filter.
                It may be tempting to buy a very high MERV rated filter, however these don't flow air as well as their
                lower
                rated counter parts especially in thin 1 inch filters. A MERV 8 filter is a good middle ground. Its
                usually a good idea to buy a couple filters at once, store extra filters in their
                original packaging in a safe spot.</p>
              <h4>Supplies</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Flat and philips head screwdriver</li>
                <li>Flashlight</li>
                <li>New filter</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Steps</h4>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>Before changing the filter, make sure the HVAC system has been turned off.</li>
                <li>Remove any filter covers.</li>
                <li>Remove the old filter.</li>
                <li>Remove the packaging from the new filter, on a visible edge of the filter write the date that it was
                  installed.</li>
                <li>Install the new filter, make sure that the air flow arrow is pointed in the correct direction. If
                  installing into a
                  furnace or air handler the arrow should point toward the unit. If installing into a return grill, the
                  arrow should point
                  into the duct.</li>
                <li>Reinstall any grills or covers.</li>
                <li>Turn the HVAC system back on.</li>
