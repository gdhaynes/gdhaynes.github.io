              <h1 class="mb-5">What is an Accessory Dwelling Unit</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>ccessory dwelling units or ADUs are separate self contained living
                units
                tucked inside a single family home or sharing a lot with one.

                ADUs are seeing a rise in popularity thanks to cities that have recently changed or adopted laws that
                make it easier and more attractive for
                homeowners to build ADUs.

                For many homeowners, ADUs can be a great source of rental income or serve as a separate living space for
                adult
                children, extended family, or elderly parents. They can also be a work-from-home space, or a place to
                escape to or run a
                home-based business.

                Still, there are enough challenges involved in building one that its generally not a small
                undertaking. For those willing and able to build an ADU, the rewards can be substantial.
              </p>

                <img src="assets/img/small-house.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption>Accessory dwelling units are growing in popularity, because they offer an inexpensive way to
                  create housing.</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <h4>What exactly counts as an ADU?</h4>
              <h5>ADU's can take many forms including:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>a newly constructed stand-alone compact home on a lot with an existing home.</li>
                <li>a home addition that creates a separate self contained living quarter.</li>
                <li>conversion of an existing space such as garage or basement into a separate dwelling.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We commonly hear ADUs called other names, including in-law apartment, granny flat, casitas or backyard
                cottage. Once common prior to World War II, many consider ADUs to be a more affordable source of
                housing. This is because they are built without having to purchase land. Land being the biggest
                component of building housing.

                If you’re thinking about building an ADU, or buying a home with the intention of building an ADU for
                rental income or multi-generational living, here are some important factors to consider.
              </p>
              <h4>Questions to answer before building an ADU</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h5>Can I build an ADU on my property?</h5>
                  <p>
                    Before you start sketching layouts and calling contractors, check with your city or
                    county department that oversees planning, construction or zoning to make sure you’re allowed to
                    build, what you’re allowed to build, and where. Rules around ADUs vary widely across the country,
                    and can vary among cities in the same state. Also if your home falls under the governance of a
                    homeowners association (HOA), be sure to check the
                    rules there as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Who can I hire to build an ADU?</h5>
                  <p>If you’re thinking of building an ADU as a DIY project, do a realistic assessment of your skills
                    and how much you’re prepared to take on. One of the great things about ADUs, especially stand alone
                    ones,
                    is that they are small, and generally only one story tall, making constructing one doable by an
                    advanced or ambitious DIYer.
                    However, while it’s certainly possible to be your own contractor, you'll likely need skilled
                    tradespeople for certain tasks, such as plumbing
                    and electrical. You'll need to determine what you can do, given your skills and time, and what you
                    are allowed to do by code, since some codes require
                    credentialed tradespeople to do certain tasks.
                    More likely, you can expect to hire professionals to do some or all of the work, including the
                    following:</p>

                  <h6>Design:</h6>
                  <p>An architect and/or engineer to draw up plans. If you’re considering a pre-fab home or a kit, check
                    with your local building department to make sure the home you’re considering meets local building
                    codes.</p>
                  <h6>Construction:</h6>
                  <p>A general contractor who can act as conductor for the entire project, or individual contractors who
                    for electrical or plumbing work.</p>
                  <h6>Site work:</h6>
                  <p>Water, power, sewage, and grading, if needed.</p>
                  <p>If you’re hiring professionals, get recommendations from people who can vouch for their work. The
                    Federal Trade Commissions has good tips on what to look for before hiring a contractor.</p>

                  <p>Interest and growth in ADU development has given rise to companies who bill themselves as one-stop
                    shops for ADUs. Some offer their own models to choose from, which could make it less expensive than
                    building a custom ADU. If you opt for a pre-fabricated or manufactured home that can be delivered to
                    your property, check
                    with your city or county building department to make sure it meets local building codes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>How much does it cost to build an ADU?</h5>
                  <p>As a general rule ADUs don’t come cheap. Even without the land costs, the cost of construction will
                    be high
                    and viable ways of paying for it are generally limited.</p>

                  <p>The cost will depend on the size and type of ADU, the building site, the materials, fit and finish
                    specified, and
                    local wages. You can save money on the design if you live in a city that offers “pre-approved”
                    building plans
                    that homeowners can use to build their ADU either for free or for a licensing fee. The plans, which
                    can be customized to a degree, speed up the review process because they already meet the city’s
                    building code and design guidelines.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Can I finance an ADU?</h5>
                  <p>Financing can be the hardest part of the process. That’s because the majority of traditional
                    lenders don’t offer loans to construct ADUs. The few that do generally write loans only for work
                    done by professional contractors, and those loans tend to carry higher
                    interest rates and require mortgage insurance. Some funding possibilities include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Existing savings</li>
                    <li>401K loan</li>
                    <li>Cash-out refinance</li>
                    <li>Second mortgage</li>
                    <li>Home Equity Line of Credit</li>
                    <li>A construction loan</li>
                    <li>A renovation loan</li>
                    <li>A reverse mortgage</li>
                    <li>A ground lease agreement</li>
                    <li>Private money</li>
                    <li>Shared appreciation</li>
                    <li>Shared equity agreement</li>
                    <li>Alternative funds through local government or non-profits</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>How might I save on the construction cost of an ADU?</h5>
                  <p>Converting an existing space into a separate living unit is likely to cost less than new
                    construction. Keep in mind, however, that every space is different and surprises will certainly pop
                    up. Another way to cut costs is to build a dwelling from plans that have been “pre-approved” by your
                    county or city building department. Buying a pre-built model or kit home also may offer a way to cut
                    costs. Just be sure to factor in
                    all applicable costs, including utility hookups. Some pre-built models only include the structure
                    itself. You’ll want to factor in the cost of anything not included in the kit. Another way to save
                    is by using doors, cabinets, flooring and windows salvaged from other construction or demolition
                    projects
                    can also help you save money. One of the great things about using salvaged materials in an ADU is
                    that since they are small, and require less material
                    the greater the chance you will find enough material at a salvage shop. For example, a salvage shop
                    may have 150 square feet of a certain ceramic tile.
                    THis amount wouldn't be enough for many spaces inside a typical home, but would likely cover the
                    area needed in an ADU, like a kitchen, Check your local business listings to see if there are
                    salvage
                    businesses nearby.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) in your real estate market</h5>
                  <p>In cities with high housing costs, rental income can pay for the costs of development in a matter
                    of years. Rental income also can provide a homeowner with future options for downsized living
                    without having to move from their home. Legally permitted ADUs also tend to add value to a property.
                    While ADUs don’t promise
                    instant riches, they can be a good way to build wealth. Some localities, such as San Mateo,
                    California, have created ADU calculators to help people
                    determine whether area rents will generate enough to cover monthly expenses. Beyond that, there are
                    considerations about what is involved in being a landlord.
