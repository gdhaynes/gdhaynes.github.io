              <p><span class="firstcharacter">H</span>ave you moved into an apartment only to discover a bunch of things
                you dislike? Are you moving into
                your first apartment and don't know what to look for? Whether it's your first apartment of your fiftieth
                use this checklist to help spot red flags
                so you can find the perfect place.</p>

              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/apartments.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption>Finding an apartment can be exciting but it can also be a challenge. </figcaption>
              </figure>
              <h4>Assess its suitability for work from home</h4>
              <p>Many employers have now adopted permanent work-from-home or hybrid work policies. As a renter, that
                means a lot
                of time spent in your apartment. If that’s your situation, take extra care to make sure your future
                space is suitable for remote work. Will you need a dedicated office space? Do you have a partner or
                roommate who also works from home, and can you work in the same space? Is the overall environment quiet
                and distraction-free? Ask other tenants about how noisy the place is. In addition after spending a day
                working in
                an apartment, you might want to get out and do something. Is the apartment close to things that get you
                out of the house like parks,
                bike paths, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.</p>

              <h4>Assess what the surrounding area is like day and night</h4>
              <p>You may be focused on finding a new address, but its important to pay attention to the context as you
                search
                for a new place. Was it challenging to drive there or take public transportation? Are there lots of bars
                and fast-food joints nearby? Is the apartment next to a busy intersection or bus stop? If possible,
                visit this new
                place at different times of the day, but at the very least during rush hour to see just how loud the
                area gets. The big question to ask yourself is, do I feel safe and comfortable right now?</p>

              <h4>Take a look at the common areas</h4>
              <p>As you tour new apartment, pay attention to how well-kept the common areas are, the condition of
                hallways, stoops, stairwells, lawns, gardens can give you an idea of the types of people who live there
                as well as the owners.
                You might also check out where the garbage and recycling are and how well-kept that area is.</p>

              <h4>Look for signs of pests</h4>
              <p>Vermin like roaches and mice are the icons of a bad apartment and landlord, get thorough when you
                evaluate your potential new place. Bring a flashlight along to
                search corners, the insides of cabinets, and other crevices for signs of bugs,
                like droppings, or shedding.</p>

              <h4>Inspect doors and windows</h4>
              <p>Check all doors and windows to see that they open and close and latch and lock. But then take it a step
                further and investigate how energy efficient they might be. Do exterior doors need door sweeps replaced?
                Are old windows painted shut or very drafty? They could cost you a lot of money in the future when it
                comes to heating and cooling your place if you have to pay utilities.</p>

              <h4>Inspect all plumbing</h4>
              <p>Few people think to run all the faucets, showers and other fixtures and flush all the toilets, but
                doing so can give you indications about the
                state of the plumbing. If the toilet(s) doesn’t flush well or runs very long, you could end up spending
                extra money on your water bill and having to deal with maintenance, same goes for leaking faucets and
                showers. Check the shower for proper pressure and temperature. If you’re
                able to check the water heater, does
                it look like its in good condition, or does it look old and worn out? A worn-out water heater can
                significantly impact your
                shower temperature and water bill. Lastly check all the shut off valves for proper operation, all sinks,
                toilets, and hot water heaters should have shut off valves.</p>

              <h4>Inspect the electrical system</h4>
              <p>Before touring an apartment get yourself an outlet tester and familiarize yourself with its operation.
                When touring an apartment, check all outlets for proper operation.
                Also make sure there are enough sockets in each room for the electronics you use and
                check to see if they have GFCI outlets in the bathroom and kitchen. Also check and make sure all
                switches and light fixtures are working properly. Lastly check for access to the electrical panel, the
                panel should be easy to access and each circuit labeled.</p>

              <h4>Pay attention to ceilings, walls, and floors</h4>
              <p>Look for stains that might indicate active leaks and large cracks that may
                reveal serious foundation issues. Look for signs of moisture or mold. Examine the flooring to see if
                it’s relatively clean and whether or not there’s damage, loose boards, or tripping hazards.</p>

              <h4>Make sure you get cell reception</h4>
              <p>Make a call to test the building’s cell reception. Do a quick search for what
                internet providers work in that area and see if it’ll be enough for your digital needs.</p>

              <h4>Talk to a few current tenants</h4>
              <p>Don’t feel like you have to go knocking on everyone’s doors, but if you see any potential new neighbors
                out and about, say hello, introduce yourself, and ask them how they like living there and how they get
                along with the landlord. Don’t let their words be the final say of whether or not you choose to rent,
                but take them into account like everything else you’ve checked off from this list.</p>

              <h4>Pay attention to parking</h4>
              <p>Is a parking spot included in your rent, or will you have to pay extra for it? Is it a covered spot,
                street parking, or in a secure garage? Will you feel safe walking to and from the parking area at night?
                If you have guests, where will they park, and what will it cost? Also, check to see if any disruptive
                events occur in the neighborhood and whether they will affect your parking arrangements. If you ride a bicycle is 
              there bike racks or better yet covered bike parking?</p>

              <h4>Practice the commute</h4>
              <p>If you have an in person or hybrid job do a test run of your commute from the apartment to
                your job. Either go during your usual commuting time or, if you have to go on a weekend, make a mental
                note of how much longer the drive would take during rush hour. Sometimes a route that looks relatively
                painless on Google Maps turns out to be more of a headache than expected.</p>
