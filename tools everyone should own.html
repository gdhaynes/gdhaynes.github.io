              <h1 class="mb-5">DIY vs Professional</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hether you are a homeowner, or a renter there is something
                empowering about having your own tools
                and being able to fix repair you're own things. It means you don't have to call a handyman, friend, or
                maintenance to tighten a cabinet, or install
                a light fixture.
              </p>

                <figcaption>There are plenty of jobs that can be done DIY, but there are many that are better left to
                  pros.</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <h4>Hammer</h4>
              <p>A hammer is the hardest working tool you’ll ever own. And it should be at the top of your list of tools
                everyone needs.
                You can use it to hit nails, of course, but you can also use a hammer to pound the lid shut on a paint
                can, tap a picture hanging hook into
                the wall or drive a wooden stake in your garden. There’s a slew of hammer types, but
                get a claw hammer, which can handle
                most household repairs. Claw hammers can weigh as much as two pounds, but leave those to professionals
                who frame houses for a living. You want a hammer that weighs around a pound.</p>

              <h4>Tape measure</h4>
              <p>Tape measures are the second most essential tool for everyone. Get one that is 25 feet long so you
                can measure both big and
                little stuff. Look for a tape measure that’s marked for fractions of an inch ­— down to 1/16 is best ­—
                so you can measure
                with precision.</p>

              <h4>Pliers Set</h4>
              <p>Opt for a three-piece set that includes slip-joint, needle-nose and diagonal pliers so you can get a
                grip on whatever you need to work on.
                Use pliers for tightening bolts, removing nails or bending wire.</p>

              <h4>Tongue and groove pliers</h4>
              <p>Get these pliers in addition to the set. Their big jaws (think giant slip-joint pliers) are
                useful for gripping pipes, fittings,
                fasteners and other large items. You can use tongue and groove pliers to change a shower head,
                disconnect your washing machine or make basic plumbing repairs.</p>

              <h4>4-in-1 screwdriver</h4>
              <p>Instead of buying a set of screwdrivers, opt for this affordable tool that does the work of four
                screwdrivers.
                It comes with two pairs of double-ended heads (called bits) that can be swapped out of the screwdriver
                handle. One head has two flat-head tips,
                and the other has two Phillips heads. You can do everything from tightening a hinge to assembling
                furniture with a 4-in-1.</p>

              <h4>Socket wrench set</h4>
              <p>A socket wrench is basically a wrench with multiple heads. Instead of buying a bunch of conventional
                wrenches in a range of sizes, get a socket wrench set.
                You get a single handle and a set of sockets that will tackle almost any household task. Best of all,
                socket wrenches have a ratcheting handle so you can
                turn a bolt or nut more quickly. No need to move the tool as you turn the fastener. A set of 25 sockets
                with both standard and metric sockets is plenty for a starter kit.</p>

              <h4>Levels</h4>
              <p>Get two. No need to eyeball in and up with pictures hung askew and sloping shelves. A small one, 9 to
                12 inches long, is useful for hanging pictures or
                mounting shelves, and a middle-sized one, 2 feet long, is good for bigger jobs like laying outdoor
                pavers or hanging cabinets.</p>

              <h4>Flashlight</h4>
              <p>You can’t fix or install what you can’t see. Add a portable light source to your toolbox in the form of
                an LED flashlight. Look for one that’s small (8 to 10 inches long), can stand upright,
                is powerful, and has a long runtime on standard batteries. Get one with a water-resistant plastic or metal case
                so it can withstand humidity. Keep a spare set of batteries in the toolbox at all times.</p>

              <h4>Nails and screws</h4>
              <p>Buy one box each of assorted nails and screws, so you are ready for any household task, from hanging a
                picture to repairing the deck. Look for assortments
                that include 6 to 10 types of nails and screws. A picture hanging kit — an assortment of nails, screw
                eyes and hanging wire — is also good to keep on hand.</p>

              <h4>Utility knife</h4>
              <p>All that online shopping you’ll be doing to furnish and decorate your home means you’ll be opening
                a lot of boxes. Don’t do it with a bread knife.
                Get a utility knife with a retractable blade that can be replaced. This little tool can cut cardboard,
                heavy-duty tape, rope and carpeting, strip cable insulation,
                scratch out old grout or caulk and more.</p>

              <h4>Multi-tool</h4>
              <p>This multipurpose gadget has between 9 and 21 tools, depending on the model. Most multi-tools have
                pliers, a knife, a ruler, scissors and a screwdriver or two.
                Higher-end models have a pry tool, saw, awl, wire cutters and lots of screwdrivers. Multi-tools have
                been a staple camping accessory for generations, but it’s a
                good idea to put one in your home toolbox because they can fill gaps in your tool arsenal.</p>

              <h4>Duct tape</h4>
              <p>This heavy-duty adhesive tape is a jack of all trades and has a recurring role on lists of tools every
                homeowner needs. It can keep loops of extension
                cords under control, patch a rip in patio furniture, repair a leaky garden hose or get dog hair off the
                sofa. It comes in a ton of colors and patterns,
                so your fast repair can be made with tie-dye or puppy print duct tape, not just industrial silver.</p>

              <h4>Cordless drill</h4>
              <p>Battery-powered drills are the best power tool to have in your arsenal of essentials. We suggest
                getting one with interchangeable tips so it can
                double as a screwdriver. Get a full set of tips — called bits — that includes a drill tip, screwdriver,
                hex head and star head so you can do any job you need to do,
                from screwing hangers for heavy pictures into wall studs to assembling furniture. A cordless drill is
                much more efficient than a screwdriver you turn by hand.</p>

              <h4>Stud finder</h4>
              <p>Studs are narrow vertical pieces of wood that hold up your walls. When you hang a heavy framed photo or a shelf holding
                heavy items, you need to find a stud because it
                will hold a screw or nail more securely than the drywall.</p>

              <h4>Lubricating oil</h4>
              <p>So much depends on having this handy: a spray can of lubricant can stop doors from
                squeaking, garden shears from rusting, loosen
                an uncooperative door lock, and unstick stuck zippers. This stuff is a miracle in a can and is one of the
                essential tools for everyone.</p>

              <h4>Allen wrench set</h4>
              <p>You know those little L-shaped metal tools that come with Ikea furniture? They’re called Allen wrenches
                — or hex keys — and you should get a whole set
                of them so you always have the one you need for any job. You can use Allen wrenches to turn bolts and
                screws with hexagon-shaped sockets, so they’re good for
                putting together furniture, working on appliances, repairing power tools, tightening towel bars or
                toilet paper holders or repairing a faucet. You can even
                use an Allen wrench to pick your lock if you lock yourself out of your house.</p>

              <h4>Extension cord</h4>
              <p>Bring the power where you need it, whether to a drill or a string of lights on the patio. An extension
                cord can keep you from ever being too far from an
                electric outlet to get work done. Cords come in light-, medium- and heavy-duty based on how much
                electricity they can handle. A medium-duty extension cord can
                handle most household needs, like powering a lamp or television or running a couple of small power
                tools.</p>

              <h4>Toolbox</h4>
              <p>Now that you have the tools every homeowner needs, you need a container to store them in so you aren’t
                rummaging around the storage room looking for a hex key
                when the towel rack falls off the wall. Use one of those plastic, five-gallon buckets the big box
                hardware stores sell, a big duffle bag or go for a retro metal
                toolbox like the one your grandpa had. The idea is you want your tools in one place so you can grab them
                and take them to the scene of the needed repair.</p>
