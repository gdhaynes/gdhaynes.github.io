              <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>t was sometime in late 2022 when DB pitched the idea of going to
                the <a href="https://www.nahb.org/">National Association
                  of Homebuilders </a> (IBS) in Las Vegas Nevada. Personally I don't see the appeal
                of Vegas, but DB and I both worked very
                hard over the past two years, and the company has done well, and we had never been to a builders show so
                I figured why not. Plane tickets were
                bought, a hotel was booked, and registration was paid, and soon enough
                I found myself on an airplane headed to sin city.
              </p>
              <h4>Recap</h4>
              <p>This was our first time at IBS and the Las Vegas Convention Center, both of us were completely blown
                away at the size of
                of it, at 2.5 million square feet its one of the largest convention centers in the world. We were
                pleasantly surprised
                to find that in addition to IBS there was also the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show (KBIS) and National
                Hardware Show (NHS) all happening
                at the same time, together all the expos took place during Design and Construction week and occupied
                nearly every square foot of the convention center. In total there were ~110,000 people in attendance and
                thousands of vendors.
                Over the next three days we walked around 30 miles just inside the
                convention halls, through IBS, KBIS, and NHS, we attended a few demos and seminars
                but spent most of our time roaming through the halls looking for the latest in tools and building
                technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our first day was spend mostly looking through KBIS which occupied two convention halls. There were
                strong showings from
                lesser known and international appliance manufacturers, in particular there were a lot of ranges, vent
                hoods,
                tubs, showers, faucets, shower drains, and almost every sink design imaginable. There were also lots of
                demonstration kitchens. We did
                see a little bit of IBS on that day and saw some electrical and HVAC vendors.</p>
              <p>
                Our second day was spent mostly at IBS, which was spread through two and a half convention halls, there
                were strong showings from window
                and door manufacturers, building material suppliers, and HVAC suppliers. We were disappointed that there
                weren't many tool manufacturers.
                We also briefly checked out the NHS which consisted of mostly asian manufacturers presumably looking for
                distributer and vendors here in the
                United States.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our third day was spent mostly at IBS, we checked out the outdoor exhibits and were hoping to see
                Timbertech, whose products we have installed
                on a number of decks and porches, however they were not there. There were some complete prefab homes and
                accessory dwelling units, we were generally impressed with their look and apparent quality.
                We also attended a seminar on client contractor relations, which we found to be mostly helpful. In
                addition we attended
                a roofing demo where they demoed how to install over Zip system roof decking. Which we learned that the
                primary advantage of Zip Sytem is that it makes the building water tight
                before the roofing and cladding are installed. This allows flexibility with scheduling other trades like
                siding installers, roofers, electricians, plumbers, etc.
              </p>
              <p>Overall we enjoyed Design and Construction week and will likely attend in the future. We'll definitely
                do some more planning and try to identify speakers, and demos that we want to
                go to before hand
              </p>
              <h4>What we liked</h4>
              <ul>
                <h5>Warmboard radiant system</h5>
                <p>This is a radiant heat system that uses a standard wood core, but features a continuous aluminum
                  cladding at the top, this gives great thermal conductivity
                  and increases the efficiency of the system.

                <h5>Naturekast cabinets</h5>
                <p>This is a manufacturer of outdoor cabinets, and kitchens. Their products have a nice look and appear
                  very sturdy.

                <h5>Rheem heat pump hot water heater</h5>
                <p>This is a hot water heater that uses a heat pump to heat the water, Rheem claimed these units as the
                  most efficient
                  hot water heaters on the market.

                <h5>Karran Laminate undermount sink</h5>
                <p>Undermount sinks look great for their lack of edge, but mounting them to laminate poses a problem.
                  Because laminate has an mdf
                  backer it will swell when water contacts it. But Karran had a demo installation where the undermount
                  sink mounts directly to the laminate creating a
                  water tight seal.
                </p>

                <h5>POMCube whole house battery backups</h5>
                <p>We've all heard of generator backups, but POMCube makes a whole house battery backup, we like this
                  because it is less maintenance than a conventional
                  backup generator.
                </p>

                <h5>Huber products</h5>
                <p>Huber makes a line of innovative construction products, including Zip System which is wall and roof
                  material that has an
                  integrated water resistant barrier (WRB). They also make
                  a tape that seals the joints between panels. We've used this product before and love it because it
                  saves time and money compared to a conventional system. New to us is Exacor, a magnesium oxide
                  underlayment
                  panel that is used in applications where sound deadening and fire protection are needed.

                </p>
                <h5>RSG Panels</h5>
                <p>RSG makes a panel product that consists of a heavy wire structure with a foam core. These panels can
                  easily be assembled onsite, into a building shell.
                  Once this is done mechanicals are roughed in and the entire building shot with concrete. This creates
                  a strong and energy efficient structure that goes up fast.
