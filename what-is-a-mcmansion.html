              <h1 class="mb-5">What is a McMansion</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he term McMansion is a negative word for an oversized suburban
                home that
                can easily be described as a caricature of a proper mansion. While they are large
                and may look impressive from afar they lack the qualities of the mansions that they draw inspiration
                from. They are built with production quantity on boring suburban lots
                with cheap materials, and they lack quality and character in their interior and exterior designs.</p>

              <h4>History</h4>
              <p>After World War II the United States began pursuing a policy of de densifying housing, this was achieved by use
                of single family zoning, the interstate highway system, and subsequent
                demolition of vast swathes of American cities to make way for parking and highways. </p>

              <p>One result of this policy was the proliferation of the American suburb a now ubiquitous aspect of
                American culture characterized at the mid century by modest single story mid century modern and one and
                a half story cape cod homes. Fast forward a few decades to the 1980s
                and a gap appeared in the now cemented suburban landscape, there were monolithic blocks of tract homes,
                and upscale custom homes in gated communities. Builders
                saw an opportunity for a larger home in a conventional suburb that would fit this gap, and the result of
                filling this gap was the
                McMansion, born in 1980s
                suburban California.
              </p>

              <p>These homes proved to be a success and demand grew dramatically. McMansions began cropping up across
                the United States
                throughout the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. Often times modest homes in mature neighborhoods would be
                demolished to make way for these oversize homes
                which seemed to push at the lot lines. They were also built in new developments, with enormous lots, far
                away from cities and older suburbs and the amenities
                that they provide. The McMansion craze continued until the mortgage crisis of the late 2000s which put
                an enormous damper on McMansion construction, which has largely
                continued to this day only to be replaced by McModerns and McFarmhouses.
              </p>

              <h4>Defining Characteristics</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h5>Oversized and Mass Produced</h5>
                  <p>
                    Generally McMansions are greater than 3000 square feet, they are also often designed and built by
                    builders rather than architects.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Cheap Materials</h5>
                  <p>
                    McMansions have a desire to look good, but lack the materials, its not uncommon to see a McMansion
                    wearing an exterior of vinyl siding.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Poorly executed architectural style</h5>
                  <p>
                    McMansions will look similar to a certain architectural style, but they don't get it right. Often
                    their proportions and balance will be off
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Clashing Forms</h5>
                  <p>
                    Generally McMansions will have clashing forms, for example towers and turrets on an otherwise boxy
                    home.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Towering Interiors</h5>
                  <p>
                    Two story foyers and great rooms clad with picture frame windows are a staple of the McMansion.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>Awkward Interior Space</h5>
                  <p>
                    With all that interior space comes awkward use of it, usually rooms are too big for their intended
                    use, but too small to be reconfigured
                    into more useful and proportional space.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Criticisms</h4>
              <p>Despite their popularity for many decades McMansions have joined a list of disliked American architectural and
                development trends for many people and I am certainly one of them.
                First is that they are not human scale, these homes are huge and their huge size leaves them cold and
                uninviting. Second is that they are a crowning example
                of bad architecture, and bad craftsmanship, which stings even more knowing that if the budget for a
                McMansion was used for a more modest house, the work quality would
                have been much better. Third is that they generally don't fit the form of the neighborhood they are in,
                they are often significantly bigger that their surrounding homes. Fourth
                is that they are resource intensive, they require lots of material to build, and large amounts of energy
                to heat and cool, they are also often very far from work, school, and shopping and aren't on transit
                lines necessitating
                car ownership. McMansions may have some fans, but in this authors opinion I'm glad to see the craze die off.</p>
